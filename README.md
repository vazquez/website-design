# Website Redesign

I want to document the redesign of my website.

My website looks like this at the moment:

I like it. It works well. But I am looking for something new.

Here we go.

- I want something clean, with minimal colours (2 max).
- I want clean typography and legible text.
- I want beautiful imagery.
- I want a single page website, but separate project pages.
- I want a friendly but elegant tone.
- I want to explore layout options, go with something funky. Why not?

- Blue background would span the height of the viewport

- Finessing things over.
- Adding some navigation.

- Added wordmark
- Hover state on navigation
- Started to design the content section. I like the big text, but the layout might change.
- Content is the same as my current website. That will change, but for now it should work :)

- I like where this is going. Adding a section on the right with quick facts.

- I'm starting to work on the Projects section of the site. I think it looks nice and clean. Maybe I need to bump up the px value of the text.
